# Guess the Number Game
Guess the Number is an interactive C console game where the computer randomly selects a secret number, and the player tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts. The game offers three difficulty levels — Easy, Medium, and Hard — with feedback provided after each guess to guide the player towards the correct number.
